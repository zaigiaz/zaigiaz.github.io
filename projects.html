<h3>Cruft Crawler (Capstone)</h3>
<p> Cruft Crawler is my capstone project that I'm currently working on.
  It profiles the filesystem and then anaylzes it for any 'Cruft' (temp files, log files, etc.) and then
  gives you an AI powered report through an html page. </br></br> It will have sled as a backend DB and allows you to flag files or directories for deletion.
It is implemented in Rust and uses the Rust Steady-State Library to section off the codebase into multiple
actors that pass messages between each other.

<h3>Math Parser</h3>
<p> Idle-Gnosis began as a simple calculator project and evolved into an exploration of parsing algorithms and interpreter design. I focused on maximizing parser throughput while minimizing compilation impact. Using a 50 MB test corpus (~600,000 lines), I optimized the parser to read and interpret the entire dataset in under 20 seconds.

<h3>Browser Dashboard</h3>
<p> Browser Dashboard is a startpage for your browser that interacts with both Weather and Reddit API's to provide you news, while also providing links to common websites you may use. <br><br>
    It can search and display Reddit posts while also being able to get the weather from any location by just searching its name.

<h3>Sentiment Anaylsis</h3>
<p>For a software engineering course, I scraped headlines and articles from news and business websites and applied Hugging Face models to evaluate sentiment polarity and generate article summaries.
 </p>

<h3>Web Server</h3>
<p> For a networking class, I implemented a multithreaded web server in C capable of serving HTML and static assets (images, GIFs, etc.) and listing directory contents. </p>
